Yes, we are mad. The issue here is that we deal with this so many times, even though we have so many questions in place to ensure that you know to do office-hours beforehand, but you seem to just blatantly ghost us just for sake of some sweet sweet 18-hole rounds. We're hope you are fully aware of the issue and hope that you are able to help us. Imagine having to tell people over and over again why there is no office-hours just because you decided to ghost us, instead of just telling us that it's canceled until July. It's.. it's something else.
